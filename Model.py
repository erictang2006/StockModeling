Stock Trading Model

This model implements a trading strategy designed to outperform the S&P 500 index fund.
It leverages historical market data, technical indicators, and machine learning algorithms
to identify optimal buy and sell signals. The model backtests its performance against the
S&P 500 to ensure consistent outperformance over various market conditions.

Attributes:
    data (pd.DataFrame): Historical stock price data.
    indicators (dict): Technical indicators used in the model.
    model (sklearn estimator): Trained machine learning model for signal prediction.

Methods:
    train(): Trains the machine learning model on historical data.
    predict(): Generates buy/sell signals based on the trained model.
    backtest(): Evaluates the model's performance against the S&P 500 index.
